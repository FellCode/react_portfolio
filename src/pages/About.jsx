              <p>Hi, im Felix, or FellCode on the Internet thing. Iâ€™m a young Software Developer from Germany and i have a weak spot for Web Development. I finished my apprenticeship as a Programmer and worked for a couple of Companies developing Insurance Software with C++ or Java. When i got the opportunity i deep dived into the world of web development with Javascript and all the lovely Frameworks and stuff. And i loved it. Therefore im always looking for some cool web projects and maybe even a job, where i can use some of the bleeding edge web stuff. 
              As for the creative part, i love to go out and do some photo shootings. It gives me the right balance between the logical part of coding and letting some of my creativity flow.</p>
